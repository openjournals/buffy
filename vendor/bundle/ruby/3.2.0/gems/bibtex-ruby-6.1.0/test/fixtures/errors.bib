In strict mode we cannot have the AT symbol anywhere except inside literals
or comment objects.

Unbalanced braces in string literal:
@string{ foo = "foo }

Another unbalanced braces in string literal:
@string{ foo = "foo{"} }

Another unterminated string literal:
@string{ foo = "foo{" }

A valid objects after two invalid ones:
@string { foo="foo"}

Unterminated literal:
@preamble    {  "{" # foo # "bar" }

Valid object:
@preamble {
	"preamble"
	
}

Bad Syntax:
@book{
	author = "An Author"
}

@book{key
	author = "An Author"
}

@book{key,
	author = "An Author"
	title = "The Title"
}

Unterminated string:
@book{key,
	author = "An Author,
	title = "The Title"
}

Better syntax:
@book{ key, author ="An Author", title = "The Title"}

Unterminated object:
@preamble{ "hello"

@string
{ bar =
"bar"

Better:
@string

{
  bar
  =
  "bar"

}
